## üìù Course 4: HTML and CSS in depth

*Nevertheless I also used Javascript and JQuery in this project*

## ‚úç Graded Assessment. Portfolio Project

### Instructions

1. Select one of the fictional clients provided in the Subject selection
2. Add the required sections on your home page. (Header, Nav, Main, Footer)
3. Set up a grid-based or flexbox CSS Layout.
4. Create two rows for the main content.
5. Create one full-width column for the first row of the main content.
6. Create three columns for the second row
7. Create two half-width columns for the footer

You are free to use your creativity but the home page needs to meet certain criteria regarding the following:

- Visual layout

- Semantic structure

- CSS layout

- CSS styling

- CSS effects

### Subject selection

For the graded assessment, you need to develop a home page for one of four fictional clients. As you read through the client personas included in this reading, think about what the ideal home page for each of these clients would look like.
How can you use what you‚Äôve learned over the course? For instance, how will you structure the provided information with semantic HTML tags? You can even start to think about what media elements you could include.
And how can you create a unique user experience with CSS? Will a grid or basic flexbox serve the client best? What CSS selectors will you use to not only style your page but also create interactivity? And don‚Äôt forget about effects! It‚Äôs time to have fun and think about how you can apply what you learned about CSS animations.
The four client personas offer a great variety for you to choose from. They are:  
- Retail: Lucky Shrub  
- Professional services: Hair Day  
- Restaurant: Little Lemon  
- Luxury jewelry: Mangata and Gallo
